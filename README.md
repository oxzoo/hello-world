tutorial for github

Hi Humans!

Today i learn about github which have repository, branch and issue. I also learned about commit, which sounds really cool here.
I am working on an exciting project, hope I can do a good job and get the return offer!

The things I learned these days are keep calm and stay focus. You are on the right track
